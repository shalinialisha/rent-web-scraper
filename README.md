## Overview
This is the first of a few experiments to create a tool that would provide Nashville residents with affordable rent options. 

## My Process
I started by looking up the most popular websites to post rental listings. I quickly learned that most of them implement protections against web scraping. However, I was committed to completing this simple project. I finally found a website that worked: padmapper.com.

## What I learned
Since this was my first Python project, I learned how to code with Python! Now, I appreciate how simple it can be to code in Python. I also gained a deeper understanding of how containers in HTML work together because I was searching through them to scrape the information I wanted. Finally, I developed a much greater understanding of JavaScript from trying to scrape JS elements (and quickly realizing it is much different than HTML elements!). 

## Continued development
After learning about web requests and limits, I am now going to try using APIs and build a more fleshed out web app.
